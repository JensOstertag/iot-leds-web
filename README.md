## About
This web application allows to control WS2812B LED strips over WiFi.
Other controls often fail to allow customization of animations and often have proprietary controls.
In this application, every user can create their own animations.

The counterpart to this application, the [device controller](https://github.com/JensOstertag/iot-leds-device), consists of an ESP8266 microcontroller, which then controls the LED strip.
The animation information is pushed by the web application through WebSockets, for which a [WebSocket server](https://github.com/JensOstertag/WS-PushServer) is required.
